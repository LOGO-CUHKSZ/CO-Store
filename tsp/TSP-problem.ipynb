    "# Implementation of Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll go through all the  concepts from the definition and make Python implementation choices for each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance:** The straight-line distance between two points in a two-dimensional plane (or between two cities on a map) is called the [**Euclidean distance**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance). I'll implement that with a function `distance(A, B)`. This distance measure is **non-negative** and **symmetric** (the distance from `A` to `B` is the same as the distance from `B` to `A`). But not all distance metrics are like this. If you have to follow roads rather than straight lines, the distance is at the whim of the road-builders. Perhaps the distance from `A` to `B` is different than the distance from `B` to `A` because of one-way streets. Or perhaps you are taking plane flights and the total time of going from `A` to `B` to `C` is less than going directly from `A` to `C` (because `B` is a hub with frequent flights). Almost everything in this notebook still holds with a different distance function; I'll  point out where it doesn't.\n",
    "- **City:** Given the choice of a Euclidean distance function, the only thing we need to know about a city is its position on the (*x*, *y*) plane. We don't need to know the city's name, population, best restaurants, or anything else. I will define `City` so that `City(300, 100)` creates a point with *x*-coordinate 300 and *y*-coordinate 100. \n",
    "- **Set of cities:** A set of cities can be represented with a Python set. I'll use [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=frozenset#frozenset), which is a set that can't be changed. \n",
    "- **Tour** (also called a **cycle** or **circuit** or [**Hamiltonian path**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)): A tour that goes from city `A` to `B` to`C` and back to `A` will be represented by the list `[A, B, C]`. \n",
    "- **Shortest**: The shortest tour is the one with the smallest total tour length. `shortest(tours)` implements this.\n",
    "- **Tour length:** The call `tour_length(tour)` gives the sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour (including back to the start).\n",
    "- **Valid Tour:** A tour is valid if it visits every city exactly once and returns to the start; in other words if it is  a *permutation* of the cities.  `valid_tour` implements that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three more basic concepts, not explicitly mentioned in the definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Point:** At first glance, Python does not have a builtin type for a two-dimensional point. But  there is one: [complex numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/complex.html).  \n",
    "- **Link**: A tour consists of a sequence of **links** between cities. A link can be represented implicitly by the adjacency of two cities in a tour, or explicitly by an `(A, B)` pair of cities.\n",
    "- **TSP algorithm**: A function with the signature `tsp(cities: Cities) -> Tour`.\n",

Therefore `random_cities` has an optional argument, `seed`, with a default value. If you pass in the same seed, you will get back the same set of cities. This is true even after restarting with a different version of Python (it could possibly change with a major revision, as in Python 2 to Python 3).
